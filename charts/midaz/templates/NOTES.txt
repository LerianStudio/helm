Accessing midaz-console, midaz-ledger, and midaz-transaction using port-forward in Helm

This documentation provides instructions on how to access the `midaz-console`, `midaz-ledger`, and `midaz-transaction` services using port-forwarding in a Helm-managed Kubernetes environment.

Steps

1. Port-Forward to midaz-console:
    Use the following command to port-forward to the `midaz-console` service.

    kubectl port-forward svc/midaz-console 8081:8081

    This will forward port 8081 on your local machine to port 8081 on the `midaz-console` service.

2. Port-Forward to midaz-ledger:
    Use the following command to port-forward to the `midaz-ledger` service.
    
    kubectl port-forward svc/midaz-ledger 3000:3000
    
    This will forward port 3000 on your local machine to port 3000 on the `midaz-ledger` service.

3. Port-Forward to midaz-transaction:
    Use the following command to port-forward to the `midaz-transaction` service.
    
    kubectl port-forward svc/midaz-transaction 3002:3002
    
    This will forward port 3002 on your local machine to port 3002 on the `midaz-transaction` service

Accessing the Services
Once the port-forwarding is set up, you can access the services in your web browser or via API calls using the following URLs:
- `midaz-console`: http://localhost:8081
- `midaz-ledger`: http://localhost:3000
- `midaz-transaction`: http://localhost:3002
